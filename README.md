## Neovim configuration

Neovim is **not included** in this repository.

The Neovim config lives in a **separate Git repository** and is located at:

~/.config/nvim

This path is intentionally ignored in this repo (`.gitignore`) to keep editor
configuration versioned independently from system dotfiles.

On a new machine:
1. Clone this dotfiles repo
2. Clone the Neovim repo separately into `~/.config/nvim`
3. Open Neovim normally
